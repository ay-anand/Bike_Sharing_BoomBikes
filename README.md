## Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction for BoomBikes (US)

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict bike-sharing demand for BoomBikes in the United States. This will empower BoomBikes to optimize their business strategy and meet customer needs effectively in a post-pandemic landscape.

### Project Goals:

* **Demand Prediction:** Build a model to predict the total number of bike rentals (including casual and registered users) based on various factors.
* **Business Insights:** Gain insights into how weather conditions, seasonality, and year (indicating growing popularity) influence demand.
* **Strategic Optimization:** Utilize the model to tailor business strategies to changing demand patterns, ultimately increasing customer satisfaction and revenue.

### Data Exploration and Preparation:

* The provided dataset will be thoroughly examined to understand the features and their potential influence on bike rentals.
* Categorical variables like weather and season will be transformed from numerical codes to meaningful string representations for accurate model training.
* Careful consideration will be given to the "yr" column (indicating year) to assess its potential value in predicting demand trends.

### Model Building and Evaluation:

* We will explore various machine learning algorithms to identify the one that best predicts bike-sharing demand based on the available data.
* The chosen model will be evaluated using the R-squared score on a held-out test set to assess its effectiveness in generalizing to unseen data.
* Residual analysis will be conducted to identify any potential model biases or areas for improvement.

### Expected Outcomes:

* A robust machine learning model capable of predicting bike-sharing demand in the US for BoomBikes.
* Valuable insights into the factors impacting bike rental behavior.
* A data-driven approach for BoomBikes to optimize their business strategy and maximize profitability in the post-pandemic era.

This project contributes to the field of demand forecasting and provides tangible business value for BoomBikes by leveraging the power of machine learning to anticipate customer needs and optimize operations.
